# Find the Majority

Majority in `[l, r]` interval is the number that has appeared more than `(r - l + 1) / 2` times.

If such element doesn't exist the output will be `0`.

## Usage
First make a file named `input.txt` in the directory where `test.sh` and `2.c` are in.
Fill the input.txt like this:
```text
{number of elements} {number of queries}
{elements}
{first query}
{second query}
...
```
Run the program:
```bash
./test.sh
```
