# What is a beautiful array?

Beautiful array is an array that is a permutation of the first n natural numbers such that for every 0<= i < j < n, there is not any i < k < j such that 2 \* a[k] = a[i] + a[j].

## Usage
First to compile the program:
```bash
gcc -o 1.out 1.c -lm
```
Then to run the program:
```bash
./test.sh
```
And at last give the wanted n to the program.
